PluMA plugin that uses Tax2Tree (McDonald et al, 2011) to output a phylogenetic
tree given a taxonomy and consensus sequences.

The plugin accepts as input a TXT file of keyword-value pairs (whitespace-delimited).
Acceptable keywords are "taxonomy" and "consensus", which map to their respective
input files.

The taxonomic tree will be output as a TXT file as well.

This plugin was generated by PluGen and relies on t2t (tax2tree) being in the system PATH.
